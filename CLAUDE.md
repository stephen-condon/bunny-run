# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Prior to implementing anything beyond a simple bugfix or config change, always use plan mode. When planning, use Opus, when implementing, use Sonnet. When researching specific facts, use a Haiku subagent. Any time there is an opportunity to do something in parallel, spawn subagents to accomplish it.

## Commands

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (run once after clone)
make setup

# Run the game
go run .

# Build
go build -o bunny-run .

# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage (target: >80%)
go test ./game/... -coverprofile=cover.out && go tool cover -func=cover.out

# Run a single test
go test ./game/... -run TestFoxVisionConeDetection

# Run tests verbose
go test ./game/... -v
```

## Architecture

**Package layout:**
- `main.go` — Ebiten window init, font loading (goregular TTF), wires up `game.NewGame`
- `game/` — all game logic; the only package that may import Ebiten is `game.go` and `input.go`
- `screens/` — stateless UI renderers (menu, game over, leaderboard); **must not import `game`** to avoid a cycle

**Dependency injection:** The four interfaces in `game/interfaces.go` (`Clock`, `InputSource`, `ScoreStore`, `WorldReader`) are the seams that make everything testable. Production implementations live in `game/input.go` (`KeyboardInput`, `RealClock`) and `game/score.go` (`FileScoreStore`). Test doubles are inlined in `game/testhelpers_test.go` — there is no `fakes/` sub-package, which would recreate the import cycle.

**Game loop (`game/game.go`):** `Game` implements `ebiten.Game`. It owns a `screenState` enum and delegates to `updateMenu/updatePlaying/updateGameOver/updateLeaderboard`. Tiles and entities render as Noto Emoji sprites via `drawSprite` → `screen.DrawImage`; `ebitenutil.DrawRect` colored-rect branches are the nil-sprites fallback. HUD/UI text uses `text.Draw` with the goregular face.

**Emoji sprites (`game/sprites.go` + `game/assets/emoji/`):** Six Noto Emoji PNGs (Apache-2.0) are embedded at compile time via `go:embed`. `NewSprites()` decodes and scales each to 32×32 at startup. `game.NewGame` accepts a `*Sprites`; nil falls back to colored rects.

**World generation (`game/world.go`):** Columns are generated lazily into a `map[int][]TileType` as the camera scrolls right. Every generated column guarantees at least one passable row for the bunny (corridor). Old columns are evicted via `Evict(minCol)`. Obstacle density and fox spawn rate are driven by `game/difficulty.go`, which increments every 15 seconds.

**Fox AI (`game/fox.go`):** Three states — `Patrol` (walk A↔B), `Chase` (move to last-known bunny position), `Wander` (lost bunny in bush; random walk for 3–5 s). Detection uses a 5-tile forward vision cone (blocked by trees) plus a 1-tile peripheral circle. On spot, broadcasts an alert to all foxes within 6 tiles (Chebyshev). Bush concealment: if the bunny is on a bush tile AND no fox is within 3 tiles (Manhattan), `bunny.Hidden = true` — foxes skip detection entirely for hidden bunnies.

**Tile collision rules:**
| Tile       | Blocks Bunny | Blocks Fox | Blocks Vision |
|------------|:-----------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
| Tree       | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bush       | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Boulder    | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| FallenLog  | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

**Scores** are persisted to `~/.bunny-run/scores.json` as a JSON array sorted descending by seconds. Top-10 only; `InsertScore` handles trim. `IsTopScore` is the gate before prompting for a name.

**Screen resolution:** 1280×720, tile size 32 px → 40×22 tile grid. `Camera.X` is the only scroll state; `IsCaughtByLeftEdge` implements the left-edge death condition.

## Workflow
    1. Pull main from remote & checkout
    2. create a new branch for changes (use conventional commits naming, e.g. "feat/add-bunnies" or "chore/fix-ci" or "docs/update-claude-md")
    3. plan changes first, ask user questions to resolve any ambiguity, both ahead of time & as changes are implemented
    4. use atomic commits, leveraging conventional commits to write the commit message
    5. push your branch to the remote
    6. raise a PR, with automerge enabled
    7. poll PR every 120 seconds for 600s, failed checks should be surfaced, check also if the PR is out of sync with main, if so, remediate. If merge conflicts are detected, ask user to resolve

### Release Tagging
When ready to ship a release use:
`git tag v1.0.0`
`git push origin v1.0.0`

Ensure you follow semantic versioning based on the conventional commits scheme
